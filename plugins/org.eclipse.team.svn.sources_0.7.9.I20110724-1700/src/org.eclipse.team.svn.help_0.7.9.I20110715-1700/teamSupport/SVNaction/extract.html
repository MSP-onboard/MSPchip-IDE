<h3>Extracting changes</h3>
	<p>The extract action is provided to help people who want to apply the changes on the resource to some location.
	The changes are applied with respect to the hierarchical structure of the selection.
	If the change is the deletion, than the existing resource in the location with the same path will be deleted.
	Otherwise the existing resources will be replaced and the others will be created.<br/><br/>
	The usage area of this action is quite wide. For example the team is developing a web site. When all the proper changes
	are made the web master can apply them to the whole site by just one click. The only thing to do is to select in the history
	of the site the current state and the newer one. After that by clicking on 'Extract...' in drop-down
	menu and selecting the site root directory as a location the site becomes up to date.</p>
	<b>Synchronize View 'Extract...' and 'Extract All...' actions</b>
	<p>In Synchronize View you have a probability to extract local changes, remote changes or both.
	<br/>Using local extracting will apply your local changes comparatively to the base revision to the specified location.
	Using the remote one will apply the incoming changes to the specified location. 'Extract All' action provides a probability
	to apply both local and incoming changes, but it is disabled if the selection contains conflicting changes. To enable it you
	should merge the conflicts before extracting.</p>
	<b>History View 'Extract...' action</b>
	<p>In History View extracting is possible both when two remote revisions are selected or when one. The changes are gathered between the selected
	revisions or between the single selected revision and the previous one and then applied to the specified location. Pay special attention to the fact, that while viewing history of the
	remote resource	the remote container name is used for extract, but not local one.</p>
