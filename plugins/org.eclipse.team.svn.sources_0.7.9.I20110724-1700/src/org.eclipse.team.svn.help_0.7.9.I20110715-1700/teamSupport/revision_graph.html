<h2>SVN Revision Graph</h2>
    <i>'SVN Revision Graph'</i> is a graphical representation of history for any resource. Using Revision Graph we can see a resource history with copy operation, applied for this resource. Represented information includes information about branches and tags for resource, so it allows to see a revision history for a resource and all its branches and tags. It's a main advantage of the Revision Graph over a History View, because History View is able to display only a history for resource, but not its copies. As the result Revision Graph is very useful in case if branches and tags are used, so users can see the whole picture of resource changes together with all branches and tags, where it was used on the one screen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Revision Graph features:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Displaying of the revision graph for resource</li>
		<li>Show merge information for revision node</li>
		<li>Switching between compact and full data representation (In compact view revision with no copy operations are filtered out. Full data representation displays all revisions)</li>
		<li>Supported actions for displayed revisions: compare revisions, show content, export content, display history and other operations, available for History View (the same list of actions is available in the revision Graph)</li>
		<li>Graph zooming and thubnailing in Outline view</li>
		<li>Expanding/collapsing revisions</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
				
	<p>
		<b>Revision Graph options:</b>				
	</p>
	You can specify whether to show merge info and other options in revision graph options dialog:

			<td class="header" align ="center" valign="center">Default</td>

			<td align ="center" valign="center">Specifies whether to show all revisions or filter them on predefined default criterions. This option can be useful for large graphs.</td>

			<td align ="center" valign="center">Show merge info</td>
			<td align ="center" valign="center">Specifies whether to fetch from repository merge information and show it on revision graph. It's available only for SVN 1.5 and higher clients. Note that despite this option is enabled there can be servers which don't support merge information.</td>

	<p>This is how <i>'SVN Revision Graph'</i> looks like:</p>
	<img border = "0" src="../images/svn_revision_graph.png" alt="SVN Revision Graph"/>
	
	<p><b>Merge information:</b></p>
	<p>
		If you selected to show merge information and there were merges then merge information is presented on graph.
		Each revision node may have incoming and(or) outgoing merges which are shown on revision node by corresponding
		blue arrows directed to left or right. For each type of merges there's number near the arrow which means number
		of merges, for incoming merges there are also shown revision numbers (in brackets) affected by merges.
		By default, merge connections between nodes are not shown, as there can be lots of merge connections which
		can significantly complicate graph presentation and understanding. If you want to see merge connections for revision node you
		can either click on blue merge arrow on revision node or call corresponding action from node's context menu such
		as 'Show Outgoing Merges' or 'Show Incoming Merges'. In order to differ merge connections from general connections
		merge connections are shown in blue. If you want to hide merge connections for revision node you can either call
		corresponding context menu actions ('Hide Outgoing Merges' or 'Hide Incoming Merges') or call 'Clear Merge Connections'
		action from toolbar which hides all merge connections on graph. 
		
		This is how merge information is presented:

	<p>Merge information is also shown on tooltip for revision node where you can see all merge paths and revisions:</p>	
	<img border = "0" src="../images/graph_merge_info.png" alt="Merge info for revision node"/>
	
	<p><b>Properties View:</b></p>
	<p>
	 	There's an ability to display properties of selected revision node in <i>Properties View</i>. Open properties view, Window>Show View>Other..., select General>Properties and select interested revision node. This is how 'Properties View' for revision node looks like:<br/><br/>
	 	<img border = "0" src="../images/graph_props_view.png" alt="Properties View"/> 
	</p>	
	
	<p>
		<b>Known issues:</b>
		<ul>
			<li>There can be cases where merge info is shown for revision node but indeed merge happened not on that path but on one of its children.</li>		
			<li>Incoming and outgoing merges on revision nodes may not exactly match to each other if there were renames or moves.</li>
		</ul>	 
	</p>
	
	<p><b><i>Toolbar</i></b></p>
	<img border = "0" src="../images/graph_toolbar.png" alt="SVN Revision Graph"/>
