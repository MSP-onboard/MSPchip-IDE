<h2>About Subversive and Subversive User Guide</h2>
<p>
	Subversive is a totally new Eclipse plug-in, that provides you a probability to use supported SVN&reg clients easily directly
	from your workbench. Friendly user interface of Subversive makes it much more comfortable to operate repositories. All
	SVN&reg operations are supported and there are no difficulties while working with command line from now on.</p>
	<p>We're very pleased to announce the publication of the Subversive project proposal on eclipse.org at
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/subversive">http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/subversive</a>.</p>
	<p>This is the first step toward making Subversive part of the Eclipse standard distribution. The next step, according to
	the Eclipse Development Process, is public discussion and collaboration which aims to enhance,refine, and clarify the proposal.
	And that's where YOU come in.</p>
	<p>In this guide you can find almost everything that you expect to find while facing some problems during Subversive usage.</p>
