<h2>Subversion introduction</h2>
<p>
	Subversion&reg; is an open-source version control system. Subversion&reg; allows developers to share there projects on
	the repositories, where they are stored afterwards. Repository is much similar to a file server, except the fact, that
	it not only stores the copy of the file system, but its previous states and changing history. Subversion&reg; access its
	repositories using network, so it provides a probability for a person to work over some shared files and watch for every
	possible changes made by other developers.</p>
