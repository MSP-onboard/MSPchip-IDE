	<h1>Subversive overview</h1>
	<p>
	Subversive is a totally new Eclipse plug-in, that provides you a probability to use supported SVN&reg; clients easily directly
	from your workbench. Friendly user interface of Subversive makes it much more comfortable to operate repositories. All
	SVN&reg; operations are supported and there are no difficulties while working with command line from now on.<br/>
	For more information refer to the <a href="gettingStarted.html">Getting started</a> part of the documentation.</p>
	
	<h2>Getting SVN Connectors</h2>
	<p>In order to work with SVN the plug-in user should also install one of SVN connectors, which are distributed from different update-site
	through the legacy reasons. The plug-in won't work without SVN Connectors.
	So please pay special attention to this fact in the <a href="gettingStarted/aboutSubversive/install.html">Installation instruction</a>.</p>
